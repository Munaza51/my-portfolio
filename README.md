Portfolio website

I am Munaza, a Full-Stack Devloper from the Afghanistan and Finished learning the full-stack Engineer Career Path on Codecademy.com. I am learning to code every single day. as I am writing this, it's day: 170.

In this README file I am keeping track of the progress of building this website. I am building this portfolio because it's good to have place where you can show your skills and this is also a project from Codecademy.
Project Objectives

    Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript

Prerequisites:

The plan

Build a website with HTML and CSS an a bit of Javascript. For the JS part I am thinking of building a simple darkmode.

    a main section with information about me, a picture of me, a list with projects I have done, My skills and languages.
    a small footer
    a simple contact page

For the layout I'll use the same layout as Codecademy's sample project for now.
